# DiseaseTagger
This is a deep-learning-based tool to identify disease ontology from raw texts. It is generated by retraining the [BioBERT large v1.1](http://nlp.dmis.korea.edu/projects/biobert-2020-checkpoints/biobert_large_v1.1_pubmed.tar.gz) base model.

## Requirements
This tools is built and tested on Mac M2 platform. It needs special version of tensorflow. Please see [The package file](./requiremnts.txt)

## Named-entity recognition (NER)
In plain English, a NER task is to identify a specific kind of term from the raw text. For example, we may want to identify human names, location, countries, etc from a given text. Here we are identifying the gene names from raw texts.

# Data and model preparation
## Model
We used [BioBERT large v1.1](http://nlp.dmis.korea.edu/projects/biobert-2020-checkpoints/biobert_large_v1.1_pubmed.tar.gz) as our base model (aka pretrained model, foundation model). 

To download the model:

```
cd Python
python Download_model.py dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1 --save_directory ../models --show_parameter False --show_layer0 False
```

## Dataset
The dataset comes from [NCBI disease]()

To download the dataset:

```
cd Python
python Download_dataset.py ncbi_disease --save_directory ../datasets
```
